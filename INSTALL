CHomP Installation Instructions.

PREREQUISITES
=============

First install Boost. On a Mac this can be
accomplished by obtaining the "Homebrew" software and
typing:

brew install boost

Optionally, install CImg and X11 (for graphics).

On a Mac this can be accomplished with:
brew install cimg

and by downloading and installing XQuartz. 
Note that you will need to log out and log back in after
XQuartz installs. 

INSTALLATION
============
To install CHomP, type 

./install.sh [install-prefix]

If [install-directory] is omitted the installation
will be to /usr/local on Mac OS X or Linux (which is
recommended.)

What is installed:

(1) Header files for CHomP in
 /usr/local/include/chomp/

(2) A patch to boost to allow serialization of unordered types
 /usr/local/include/boost/serialization/*.hpp

(3) Binaries for CHomP in
 /usr/local/bin/
