# CHomP -- Computational Homology Project software

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/CHomP.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shaunharker/CHomP)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/shaunharker/CHomP/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/shaunharker/CHomP?branch=master)

Documentation can be found [here](http://chomp.rutgers.edu/Projects/Databases_for_the_Global_Dynamics/software/LorentzCenterAugust2014.pdf).

This software is a tool for computational homology for both cellular complexes and induced homology on maps. It is based on discrete Morse theory. It is used to compute Conley indices in the [Conley-Morse-Database](https://github.com/shaunharker/conley-morse-database) project.
